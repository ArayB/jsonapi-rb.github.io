# Introduction

jsonapi-rb is a ruby library for producing and consuming
[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) documents. It has tight integrations with various
frameworks ([Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and
[Hanami](http://hanamirb.org) at the moment), but it is not tied to any of
those.

These guides should get you up to speed with using jsonapi-rb. If you have more
questions, feel free to drop by on [Gitter](http://gitter.im/jsonapi-rb).
